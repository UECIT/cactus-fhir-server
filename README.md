# CDS-FHIR-Server
## Running with Docker

To run this locally just run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will obtain the mySQL image, initialize the ```cdss_resources``` database and run the ```populate_data.sql``` script which creates the tables and populates with the mock data.

It will also download and run the cds-fhir-server image from the docker registry in gitlab.com.

Within the ```docker-compose.yml``` file. The mySQL host can be changed from ```cdss-mysql``` to ```localhost``` if the mysql server is being hosted on the local machine instead of the docker container.

Have a look at Docker documentation for more information.

## Running without Docker

Create a MySql database and run the sql scripts under `src/main/resources/sql`

Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to point to the database.

**Note that for MySQL 8+ references to columns named system in the script need to be updated to \`system\` as it is a reserved word and must be escaped with the back-ticks**
